class RuleListRule(Rule):
    """
    A RuleListRule provides an abstraction for combing rules together in an
    internal list.

    Say we have a two SingleLineRules that parse Integers and Strings. If we
    want a rule that combines both these rules we can use a RuleListRule. Take
    the following data.

        START DATA
        1
        hello
        2
        world
        END DATA

    We can define a RuleListRule as follows

        rules = [IntRule(), StringRule()]
        rlr = RuleListRule("START DATA", "END_DATA", rules=rules)
        parser = Parser(rlr)
        assert parser.feed(...) == [[1, 2] ["hello", "world"]]

    By default `reset` will return a list whose elements are simply whatever
    `reset` returns for each rule. Often you may want to override the `reset`
    method to return what form of data you would like.

    A RuleListRule is a Rule itself and may be further nested in other rules.

    A SingleLineRule is a rule that is meant to execute only a single line.
    That is the `start_tag` and `end_tag` are the same line, and the data to
    extract out is also on the same line. This class provides an easier
    abstraction to work with these kinds of scenarios. By default this class
    will store extracted data in a list that is returned upon `reset`. Take
    the following data

        This data is only on a single line: 42

    We can use `SingleLineRule` to easily define this as

        class TestRule(SingleLineRule):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__("This data is only")

        parser = Parser(TestRule())
        assert parser.feed(data) == [42]

    Because these rules are meant to only execute on one line, any use of the
    iterator will result in an error.
